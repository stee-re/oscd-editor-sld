 * cursor so the in-progress segment can be previewed as the user moves the
 * mouse. Committing a waypoint is therefore not a plain append — the provisional
 * last point must first be **replaced** by `corner` (the now-fixed bend where
 * the previewed segment turns), and only then are the new live endpoints
 * (`rest`) appended so the path keeps tracking the cursor from the new bend.
 *
 * The result is normalised with {@link cleanPath}, which drops any duplicate or
 * collinear points the new bend may have introduced.
 *
 * @param path - the current connection path

 * @param rest - the new live endpoint(s) extending the path past the bend

 * `corner` reuses one of its coordinates. The final, `provisional` point is used
 * **only** to reveal the orientation of the segment that arrived at `lastFixed`
 * (by comparing their x's); its coordinates are never used directly. A single
 * point could not tell us that orientation, hence both are needed.
 *
