 * variant carries its subject `element`; mode-specific extras hang off the
 * variant. The `mode` tag of each variant is the single source of truth for
 * "which gesture is active".
 *
 * This is the controller-owned *state*, projected **down** (editor → viewer) so
 * the view can render the in-progress gesture. Its reciprocal is
 * {@link InteractionIntent} (in `events.ts`), the view → editor *intent* to
 * begin a gesture. State vs. intent — same `Interaction` root, opposite

 *
 * Reserved as a possible future step: if transition guards accumulate (e.g.
 * "only append a point while connecting"), these could be folded into a single
